Today was slow, exhausting and beyond contempt. It was like this every day. The slow ticking of the clock seemed even more reluctant to continue its lullaby as the day continued. As luring as it was, Harry knew he had to stay awake. Not only was it expected of him, but angering his teacher would only cause problems at home. Crossing his Aunt and Uncle created to a string of consequences. While the days were painfully slow, the Dursley's were another issue.

While living at Number 4 Privet Drive with the Dursley's, Harry learned a lot about them. http://delfi.lt Not that the Dursley's were interesting, the Dursley's were normal. At least, the Dursley's were as normal as they could be. You could never make them admit it, but the Dursley's had something abnormal living in the house. Harry had heard both his Aunt and Uncle use the word "freak" several times. It did not take long for Harry to discover they were talking about him.
